# ðŸŒŸ Python Learning Journey: Day [2] ðŸŒŸ
# Today, I explored one of the foundational aspects of Python: Data Types. Understanding data types is essential as they define the kind of data a program can handle and how it can be processed.
# Here are the key types I learned:
# int: Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5)
 # A whole number
age = 25 
# float: Numbers with decimals (e.g., 3.14, -0.01)
pi = 3.14  # A number with decimals
# str: Strings for textual data (e.g., "Python is amazing!")
greeting = "Hello, Python!"  # A text string

# bool: Boolean values for logical operations (True/False)
is_learning = True  # True or False value

# Collections: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries for managing groups of data effectively.
#List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  # A collection of items
#Tuples
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)  # Immutable collection
#Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3}  # A collection with unique items
#Dictionary (dict):
student = {"name": "John", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}  # Key-value pairs

# Pythonâ€™s simplicity and flexibility make it a powerful tool for solving real-world problems, and Iâ€™m excited to build on this foundation as I continue learning. ðŸš€
